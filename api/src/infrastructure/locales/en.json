A doctor will not need to listen with a stethoscope \uD83E\uDE7A, looking at a sound picture of cough \uD83D\uDCC8 will be enough. Our goal is to make medicine better and more accessible!\n\nSoon we will have a collection of 100 thousand samples of cough. The accuracy of testing at the moment is 86%.\nWith your support we will be able to raise the accuracy up to 95% and more. The more cough recordings - the higher the accuracy of testing results.\nYour cough can help save lives \uD83D\uDE4C",
